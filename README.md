# Car-Price-Prediction
This is the first project that I made after learning basics of Machine Learning and Scikit learn

🚀 Project Title & Tagline
==========================

**Car Prediction Project** 🚗
**Predicting Car Prices with Machine Learning** 🤖

📖 Description
-------------
The Car Prediction Project is a comprehensive data science initiative that leverages machine learning and data preprocessing techniques to predict car prices based on various factors such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. This project is designed to provide car enthusiasts, dealerships, and manufacturers with a robust tool to forecast car prices, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

The project consists of two primary components: a data preprocessing pipeline and a predictive model. The data preprocessing pipeline is responsible for loading, cleaning, and transforming the data, while the predictive model uses the preprocessed data to forecast car prices. The project utilizes a range of techniques, including data imputation, feature scaling, and encoding, to ensure that the data is properly prepared for modeling.

The Car Prediction Project is built using Python and scikit-learn, with a focus on modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The project is designed to be easily extensible, allowing users to add new features, models, and data sources as needed. With its robust architecture and advanced predictive capabilities, the Car Prediction Project is an ideal solution for anyone looking to gain insights into the automotive market.

✨ Features
==========

The Car Prediction Project includes the following features:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, data normalization, and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Engineering**: The project includes feature engineering techniques such as creating new features from existing ones, handling categorical variables, and selecting the most relevant features.
3. **Pipeline-Based Approach**: The project uses a pipeline-based approach to build the model, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
4. **Stratified Sampling**: The project uses stratified sampling to split the data into training and testing sets, which helps to maintain the same proportion of classes in both sets.
5. **Model Deployment**: The project includes model deployment techniques such as saving the model to a file and loading it for future use.

📁 Project Structure
=====================

The project structure is as follows:

* `Car Prediction Project_('pipeline_testing and model accuracy testing.py)`: This file contains the initial code for loading the data.
* `Car Prediction Project.py`: This file contains the updated code for loading the data and building the machine learning model.
* `model_evalution.py`: This file contains an AI generated program that evaluates the model and show evaluation results.
* `dataset/`: This folder contains the dataset used for the project.
* `models/`: This folder contains the saved models.
* `output/`: This folder contains output which is generated after the model have predicted a price and saved it as a csv file.

🌐 Web Application (Upcoming)
=============================

A web-based interface is planned for this project to allow users to input car details and receive real-time price predictions using the trained machine learning model. This will make the project more interactive and closer to a real-world application. Development for the web app will be introduced in upcoming updates.
